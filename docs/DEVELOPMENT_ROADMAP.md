# Development Roadmap - Multi-Service Workflow System

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform the Numericalz Internal Management System from a basic client management platform into a comprehensive multi-service workflow management system for UK accounting firms.

## 📋 Current State vs. Target State

### Current State
- Basic client management with Companies House integration
- Simple user assignment system
- Role-based access control (Manager/Staff)
- Contact management and client profiles

### Target State
- **Multi-Service Platform**: Accounts, VAT, PAYE/Pension/CIS services
- **Parallel Workflow Management**: Multiple services per client running simultaneously
- **10-Stage Workflow System**: Standardized process for all services
- **Automated Triggers**: Service workflows start automatically based on dates/frequencies
- **Comprehensive Activity Logging**: Client-level and application-level audit trails
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live status updates without manual refresh
- **Advanced Filtering**: Service-specific views and comprehensive filtering

## 🏗️ Service Architecture Overview

### Service Types

#### 1. Accounts Service
- **Ltd Companies**: Companies House integration required
- **Non-Ltd Companies**: Manual entry (partnerships, sole traders, etc.)
- **Trigger**: Day after year-end date passes
- **Workflow**: Standard 10-stage process

#### 2. VAT Service
- **All Business Types**: Independent of company structure
- **Frequencies**: 
  - Monthly (every month)
  - Quarterly Pattern 1: Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct (1/4/7/10)
  - Quarterly Pattern 2: Feb/May/Aug/Nov (2/5/8/11)
  - Quarterly Pattern 3: Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec (3/6/9/12)
- **Trigger**: Based on selected frequency pattern
- **Workflow**: Standard 10-stage process

#### 3. PAYE/Pension/CIS Service (Future)
- **Future Implementation**: Not in immediate scope
- **Architecture**: Will follow same pattern as Accounts/VAT

### 10-Stage Workflow System

Each service follows the same standardized workflow:

1. **Paperwork to chase** (Partner/Manager)
2. **Paperwork chased** (Partner/Manager - manual update)
3. **Paperwork received** (Automatically assigned to Staff)
4. **In progress** (Staff working)
5. **Discuss with manager** (Manager review - can send back to Stage 4 or forward)
6. **Review by partner** (Partner review - can send back or forward)
7. **Approved - Send HelloSign** (Triggers HelloSign integration)
8. **HelloSign sent to client** (Waiting for client signature)
9. **Approved by client** (Client has signed)
10. **Submission approved by partner** (Final approval and completion)

### Key Features

#### Parallel Service Management
- Single client can have multiple services running simultaneously
- Example: Client at Stage 5 for Accounts + Stage 3 for VAT
- Different staff members can handle different services for same client
- Independent workflow progression per service

#### Role-Based Stage Access
- **Partners**: Can access and modify all stages
- **Managers**: Can access stages 1-6, limited access to 7-10
- **Staff**: Can primarily work on stages 3-5
- **Stage Visibility**: Users only see stages relevant to their role

#### Automation Features
- **Automatic Workflow Creation**: Services start automatically based on triggers
- **Email Notifications**: Automated alerts for stage transitions
- **HelloSign Integration**: Document signing workflow
- **Deadline Tracking**: Automatic deadline calculation and monitoring

## 🗂️ Navigation Structure

### Primary Navigation
```
Clients (Main Overview)
├── All Clients (with service status indicators)
