- **API Endpoint Simulation**: Testing assignment logic that mirrors API endpoints
- **Table Display Verification**: Ensuring assignments display correctly in all UI tables
- **Assignment Independence**: Verifying accounts and VAT assignments work independently
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Testing across different client types and scenarios

### Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests Executed**: 25+ individual test cases
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Failed Tests**: 0
- **Test Coverage**: Complete assignment workflow from creation to display

## Assignment System Architecture

### Database Schema
The assignment system uses separate fields for different assignment types:

```sql
-- Client table assignment fields
ltdCompanyAssignedUserId     -- Staff assigned for Ltd company accounts work
nonLtdCompanyAssignedUserId  -- Staff assigned for Non-Ltd company accounts work  
vatAssignedUserId            -- Staff assigned for VAT work
assignedUserId               -- General assignment (legacy, not used in new system)
```

### Assignment Logic by Company Type
- **LIMITED_COMPANY**: Uses `ltdCompanyAssignedUserId` for accounts work
- **NON_LIMITED_COMPANY**: Uses `nonLtdCompanyAssignedUserId` for accounts work
- **SOLE_TRADER**: Uses `nonLtdCompanyAssignedUserId` for accounts work
- **PARTNERSHIP**: Uses `nonLtdCompanyAssignedUserId` for accounts work
- **All VAT-enabled clients**: Use `vatAssignedUserId` for VAT work

## Test Results by Category

- Assignment endpoints work independently without interference
- Bulk operations maintain assignment integrity

### 3. Table Display Verification ✅ PASSED

**Test Script**: `scripts/test-table-display.js`

**Results**:
- ✅ Main Clients Table: Displays correct assignments based on company type
- ✅ VAT Deadlines Table: Shows VAT assignments independently
- ✅ Ltd Companies Table: Displays Ltd-specific assignments
- ✅ Cross-Table Consistency: All tables show consistent assignment data
- ✅ Contact icons display correctly based on data availability

**Key Findings**:
- All tables display assignments correctly per company type
- No fallback logic - tables show specific assignments only
- Contact management functionality preserved
- Responsive design maintained across all device sizes

### 4. Assignment Independence Testing ✅ PASSED

**Test Script**: `scripts/test-assignment-integration.js`

**Results**:
- ✅ Ltd Accounts Assignment: Independent from VAT assignments
- ✅ Non-Ltd Accounts Assignment: Independent from VAT assignments
- ✅ VAT Assignment: Independent from accounts assignments
- ✅ Assignment Independence: Verified across all scenarios
- ✅ Table Query Compatibility: All queries return correct independent data

**Key Findings**:
- Accounts and VAT assignments are completely independent
- Changing one assignment type does not affect the other
- System supports different users for accounts vs VAT work
- All assignment combinations work correctly

## API Endpoint Compatibility

### Verified Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/clients/[id]/assign-accounts` - Assigns accounts work
- ✅ `POST /api/clients/[id]/assign-vat` - Assigns VAT work independently
- ✅ `POST /api/clients/bulk-assign-work-type` - Bulk assignments
- ✅ `GET /api/clients` - Main clients table data
- ✅ `GET /api/clients/vat-clients` - VAT deadlines table data
- ✅ `GET /api/clients/ltd-deadlines` - Ltd companies table data

### Assignment Priority Logic
**VAT Deadlines Table Assignment Display**:
1. Active workflow assignee (`client.currentVATQuarter?.assignedUser`)
2. VAT assigned user (`client.vatAssignedUser`)
3. 'Unassigned' if neither exists

**Main Clients Table Assignment Display**:
- **Accounts Column**: Shows specific assignment based on company type (no fallbacks)
- **VAT Column**: Shows VAT assignment or 'VAT Disabled' if not enabled

## UI/UX Verification

### Table Display Standards ✅ VERIFIED
- **Fixed Table Layout**: Prevents horizontal scrolling
- **Column Widths**: Specific widths for each column type
- **Contact Icons**: Email (Mail) and Phone icons with proper click actions
- **Assignment Display**: Clear indication of assigned users or 'Unassigned'
- **Responsive Design**: Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Contact Management ✅ PRESERVED
- **Email Icons**: Open `mailto:` links correctly
- **Phone Icons**: Open `tel:` links correctly
- **Icon Sizing**: Consistent h-3 w-3 for contact icons
- **Hover Effects**: Proper color transitions and tooltips

## Performance Impact
