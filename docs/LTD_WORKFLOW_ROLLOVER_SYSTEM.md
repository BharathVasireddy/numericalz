# Ltd Companies Workflow Rollover System

## üéØ Overview

The Ltd Companies Workflow Rollover System automatically manages the transition of completed Ltd company accounts workflows to the next year's workflow. This ensures continuous workflow management without manual intervention.

## üîÑ Workflow Lifecycle

Status: Filed to CH&HMRC (completed)
Filed Date: 25 May 2025
```

### Rollover Process
```
1. FILING COMPLETED (25 May 2025)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Workflow marked as completed
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Companies House data refreshed
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1-month wait period begins

2. ROLLOVER TRIGGER (25 June 2025)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ System creates new workflow
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Period: 1 Oct 2025 to 30 Sept 2026
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stage: WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment: Unassigned
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Uses updated Companies House dates

3. YEAR END PASSES (1 Oct 2026)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Auto-transition: WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END ‚Üí PAPERWORK_PENDING_CHASE
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Workflow history created
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Appears in pending-to-chase dashboard
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ready for staff assignment
```

ALTER TYPE "LtdAccountsWorkflowStage" ADD VALUE 'WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END' BEFORE 'PAPERWORK_PENDING_CHASE';
```

#### 2. Enum Values (Updated)
```
1. WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END          ‚Üê NEW

### Scripts and Automation

#### 1. Rollover Script
```bash
npm run ltd:rollover
```
**File**: `scripts/ltd-workflow-rollover.js`

**Functions**:
- `rolloverLtdWorkflows()` - Main rollover logic
- `checkYearEndStatus()` - Transitions waiting workflows

**Rollover Criteria**:
- Workflow is completed (`isCompleted: true`)
- Current stage is `FILED_CH_HMRC`
- Filed date is ‚â• 1 month ago
- No existing workflow for next period

#### 2. Supporting Scripts
```bash
# Check enum values in database
node scripts/check-enum-values.js

# Add enum value to database
node scripts/apply-waiting-for-year-end-enum.js

# Demo rollover functionality
node scripts/test-ltd-rollover-demo.js
```

### UI Components Updated

#### 1. Ltd Companies Deadlines Table
**File**: `components/clients/ltd-companies-deadlines-table.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END` to `WORKFLOW_STAGES`
- Icon: Calendar
- Color: `bg-gray-100 text-gray-800`

#### 2. Advanced Filter Modal
**File**: `components/clients/advanced-filter-modal.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END` to filter options
- Label: "Waiting for year end"

#### 3. Activity Log Viewer
**File**: `components/activity/activity-log-viewer.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added stage mapping: `'WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END': 'Waiting for Year End'`

## ü§ñ Automation Setup

### Cron Job Configuration
```javascript
// Add to cron jobs (monthly execution)
const cron = require('node-cron')

// Run on 1st of every month at 2 AM
cron.schedule('0 2 1 * *', async () => {
  console.log('üîÑ Running Ltd workflow rollover...')
  await require('./scripts/ltd-workflow-rollover.js').rolloverLtdWorkflows()
})

// Run daily to check year end transitions
cron.schedule('0 3 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('üîç Checking year end transitions...')
  await require('./scripts/ltd-workflow-rollover.js').checkYearEndStatus()
})
```

## üìä Business Logic

### Rollover Decision Matrix

| Condition | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Filed < 1 month ago | Wait | Allow Companies House data to update |
| Filed ‚â• 1 month ago | Create rollover | Begin next year workflow |
| Year end passed | Auto-transition | Start active workflow |
| Companies House data available | Use official dates | Ensure accuracy |
| No Companies House data | Calculate dates | Fallback method |

### Date Calculation Priority

1. **Companies House Official Dates** (Priority 1)
   - `nextAccountsDue` from Companies House API
   - `nextYearEnd` from Companies House API
   - `nextCorporationTaxDue` calculated (year end + 12 months)

2. **Calculated Dates** (Fallback)
   - Based on current workflow pattern
   - Add 1 year to existing dates

### Assignment Logic

- **Initial Assignment**: `null` (Unassigned)
- **Rationale**: Allow managers to assign based on current workload
- **Future Enhancement**: Could use AI/ML for optimal assignment

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Rollover automation settings
LTD_ROLLOVER_ENABLED=true
LTD_ROLLOVER_WAIT_MONTHS=1
LTD_AUTO_TRANSITION_ENABLED=true
```

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ltd:rollover": "node scripts/ltd-workflow-rollover.js"
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test rollover functionality
node scripts/test-ltd-rollover-demo.js

# Check current system state
npm run ltd:rollover
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Eligible Rollover
```
Given: Workflow filed > 1 month ago
When: Rollover script runs
Then: New workflow created with WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END
```

#### Scenario 2: Year End Transition
```
Given: Workflow in WAITING_FOR_YEAR_END
And: Year end date has passed
When: Transition script runs
Then: Stage changes to PAPERWORK_PENDING_CHASE
```

#### Scenario 3: Companies House Integration
```
Given: Rollover creates new workflow
When: Companies House data is available
Then: Use official dates for accounts due
```

## üö® Error Handling

### Common Issues

#### 1. Enum Value Not Found
```
Error: Invalid value for argument currentStage
Solution: Regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
```

#### 2. Missing Companies House Data
```
Fallback: Use calculated dates based on current workflow
Log: Warning about missing official data
```

#### 3. Duplicate Workflows
```
Check: Prevent duplicate workflows for same period
Logic: Skip if newer workflow already exists
```

### Monitoring

#### Database Integrity
```bash
# Run after rollover operations
npm run db:audit
```

#### Rollover Logs
- All rollover operations logged with timestamps
- Success/failure counts tracked
- Client-specific processing logged

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing
- Process workflows in batches of 10
- Avoid overwhelming database connections
- Use transactions for consistency

### Caching
- Cache Companies House data lookups
- Minimize API calls during rollover
- Use database indexes for performance

### Monitoring
- Track rollover execution time
- Monitor database connection usage
- Alert on rollover failures

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
1. **Smart Assignment**
   - AI-based workload balancing
   - Historical performance analysis
   - Skill-based assignment

2. **Notification System**
   - Email alerts for new workflows
   - Slack integration for team updates
   - Dashboard notifications

3. **Rollover Analytics**

   - Priority-based processing

### Integration Opportunities
- **Companies House API**: Real-time data sync
- **HMRC API**: Filing status verification
- **Calendar Systems**: Deadline integration
- **CRM Systems**: Client communication

## üìã Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Monthly**: Review rollover logs
- **Quarterly**: Validate Companies House data accuracy
- **Annually**: Review rollover timing and logic

### Updates Required
- **Enum Changes**: Update UI components
- **Schema Changes**: Run safe migrations
- **Logic Changes**: Update documentation

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All rollover operations logged for audit
- No sensitive data in rollover scripts
- Secure database connections required

### Access Control
- Rollover scripts require system-level access
- Manual rollover requires MANAGER+ role
- Audit trail for all operations
