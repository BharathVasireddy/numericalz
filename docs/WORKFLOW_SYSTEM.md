### Valid Transitions

```
Stage 1 ‚Üí Stage 2 (Partner/Manager action)
Stage 2 ‚Üí Stage 3 (Partner/Manager action)
Stage 3 ‚Üí Stage 4 (Staff action)
Stage 4 ‚Üí Stage 5 (Staff action)

```

### Business Rules

1. **No Skipping Stages**: Must progress through stages sequentially
2. **Role Validation**: Only authorized roles can perform specific actions
3. **Send-Back Rules**: 
   - From Stage 5: Can only send back to Stage 4
   - From Stage 6: Can send back to Stage 4 or 5
4. **Automation Points**: Stages 3, 7, 8, 9 have automatic triggers
5. **Completion Rule**: Only Stage 10 marks workflow as complete

## üìä Parallel Service Management

### Multi-Service Clients

A single client can have multiple services running simultaneously:

```
Client: ABC Ltd
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Accounts Service (Stage 5 - Manager Review)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VAT Service (Stage 3 - Staff Working)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PAYE Service (Stage 1 - Chase Paperwork)
```

### Independent Workflows

- Each service maintains its own workflow state
- Different staff can be assigned to different services
- Services progress independently
- Separate deadlines and tracking per service

### Service Assignment

```typescript
// Example service assignments
{
  client_id: "abc-ltd",
  services: [
    {
      service_type: "ACCOUNTS_LTD",
      assigned_staff: "john.doe",
      current_stage: 5,
      workflow_data: { year_end: "2024-03-31" }
    },
    {
      service_type: "VAT",
      assigned_staff: "jane.smith", 
      current_stage: 3,
      workflow_data: { frequency: "QUARTERLY_1", due_date: "2024-01-31" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## ü§ñ Automation System

### Automatic Workflow Creation

#### Accounts Service Triggers
```typescript
// Triggered day after year-end date
if (client.accounting_reference_date < today) {
  createWorkflow({
    client_id: client.id,
    service_type: "ACCOUNTS_LTD",
    trigger_date: client.accounting_reference_date + 1,
    due_date: client.accounts_due_date
  });
}
```

#### VAT Service Triggers
```typescript
// Triggered based on frequency pattern
const vatFrequencies = {
  MONTHLY: "every month",
  QUARTERLY_1: [1, 4, 7, 10], // Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct
  QUARTERLY_2: [2, 5, 8, 11], // Feb, May, Aug, Nov  
  QUARTERLY_3: [3, 6, 9, 12]  // Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec
};
```

### Stage Automation Rules

1. **Stage 3 Auto-Assignment**: When advanced from Stage 2, automatically assigns to designated staff
2. **Stage 7 HelloSign Trigger**: Automatically creates HelloSign document when advanced
3. **Stage 8 Status Updates**: Automatically updates from HelloSign webhooks
4. **Stage 9 Completion**: Automatically advances when HelloSign reports completion

## üìß Notification System

### Email Notifications

#### Stage Transitions
- **Stage 1‚Üí2**: Notify assigned staff that paperwork has been chased
- **Stage 2‚Üí3**: Notify staff that paperwork received and assigned
- **Stage 3‚Üí4**: Notify manager that work has started
- **Stage 4‚Üí5**: Notify manager that review is needed
- **Stage 5‚Üí6**: Notify partner that final review is needed
- **Stage 6‚Üí7**: Notify admin that HelloSign should be sent
- **Stage 7‚Üí8**: Notify client that documents are ready for signature
- **Stage 8‚Üí9**: Notify team that client has signed
- **Stage 9‚Üí10**: Notify partner that final approval is needed

#### Deadline Notifications

- **3 days before**: Urgent notification
- **Day of deadline**: Critical notification
- **Overdue**: Daily overdue notifications

### In-App Notifications

- Real-time notifications for stage changes
- Workload alerts for staff assignments

## üìà Activity Logging & Audit Trail

### Workflow History Tracking

Every workflow action is logged with:

```typescript
{
  client_service_id: string,
  from_stage: number,
  to_stage: number,
  action_by_user_id: string,
  action_type: "ADVANCE" | "SEND_BACK" | "ASSIGN" | "NOTE",
  notes: string,
  created_at: timestamp,
  metadata: {
    reason?: string,
    files_uploaded?: string[],
    deadline_changed?: boolean,
    notification_sent?: boolean
  }
}
```

### Activity Types

1. **Stage Transitions**: All workflow progressions
2. **Assignments**: Staff assignments and changes
3. **File Uploads**: Document attachments
4. **Notes**: Work progress and communication notes
5. **Deadline Changes**: Due date modifications
6. **External Events**: HelloSign status updates

### Audit Compliance

- **Immutable Records**: Activity logs cannot be modified
- **Complete Timeline**: Every action is timestamped and tracked
- **User Attribution**: All actions linked to specific users
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Export Capability**: Audit trails can be exported for compliance

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Workflow states
CREATE TYPE workflow_stage AS ENUM (
  'PAPERWORK_TO_CHASE',
  'PAPERWORK_CHASED', 
  'PAPERWORK_RECEIVED',
  'IN_PROGRESS',
  'DISCUSS_WITH_MANAGER',
  'REVIEW_BY_PARTNER',
  'APPROVED_SEND_HELLOSIGN',
  'HELLOSIGN_SENT',
  'APPROVED_BY_CLIENT',
  'SUBMISSION_APPROVED'
);

-- Service types
CREATE TYPE service_type AS ENUM (
  'ACCOUNTS_LTD',
  'ACCOUNTS_NON_LTD',
  'VAT',
  'PAYE'
);

-- Workflow actions
CREATE TYPE workflow_action AS ENUM (
  'ADVANCE',
  'SEND_BACK',
  'ASSIGN',
  'NOTE',
  'UPLOAD',
  'DEADLINE_CHANGE'
);
```

### API Endpoints

```typescript
// Workflow management
POST /api/workflows/advance
POST /api/workflows/send-back
POST /api/workflows/assign
GET  /api/workflows/[clientId]/[serviceType]
GET  /api/workflows/history/[workflowId]

// Bulk operations
POST /api/workflows/bulk-advance
POST /api/workflows/bulk-assign

// Automation
POST /api/workflows/trigger-automation
GET  /api/workflows/automation-status
```

### State Machine Implementation

```typescript
class WorkflowStateMachine {
  validateTransition(from: Stage, to: Stage, userRole: Role): boolean
  executeTransition(workflowId: string, action: WorkflowAction): Promise<void>
  canUserAccess(stage: Stage, userRole: Role): boolean
  getAvailableActions(stage: Stage, userRole: Role): Action[]
}
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- **Caching**: Frequently accessed workflow states
- **Pagination**: Large workflow lists with efficient pagination

### Real-Time Updates

- **WebSocket Connections**: Live workflow status updates
- **Event Broadcasting**: Stage transition notifications
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirmation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent workflow modifications
