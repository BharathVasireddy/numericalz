# üöÇ Railway PostgreSQL Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you migrate from Supabase to Railway PostgreSQL for better reliability and performance.

## üìã Prerequisites
- Railway account (free tier available)
- Current Supabase database access
- Node.js installed locally

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Railway Account & Database

1. **Sign up**: Go to https://railway.app/
2. **Create new project**: Click "New Project"
3. **Deploy PostgreSQL**: 
   - Click "+ New" 
   - Select "Deploy PostgreSQL"
   - Wait for deployment (usually 1-2 minutes)

### 2. Get Database Connection Details

After deployment, Railway provides these environment variables:
- `PGHOST` - Database host
- `PGPORT` - Database port (usually 5432)
- `PGUSER` - Database username
- `PGPASSWORD` - Database password
- `PGDATABASE` - Database name
- `DATABASE_URL` - Complete connection string

**Copy the `DATABASE_URL`** - you'll need it for migration and Vercel setup.

### 3. Set Up Database Schema

Run Prisma migration to create the schema in Railway:

```bash
# Set Railway database URL temporarily
export DATABASE_URL="your-railway-database-url"

# Run Prisma migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Migrate Data from Supabase (Optional)

If you have existing data in Supabase:

```bash
# Set both database URLs
export SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL="your-current-supabase-url"
export RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL="your-railway-database-url"

# Run migration script
node migrate-to-railway.js
```

### 5. Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` with your Railway connection string:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
   ```
3. **Redeploy** your Vercel application

### 6. Test the Connection

```bash
# Test locally with Railway database
export DATABASE_URL="your-railway-database-url"
npm run dev

# Test the debug endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug
```

# View active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

# View table sizes
SELECT schemaname,tablename,pg_size_pretty(size) as size
FROM (
  SELECT schemaname,tablename,pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) as size
  FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public'
) s ORDER BY size DESC;
```

## üîí Security Features

- **SSL/TLS encryption** in transit
- **VPC isolation** for Pro plans

   curl -I https://your-railway-app.railway.app/
   ```

2. **Migration fails**
   ```bash
   # Reset database and re-run migrations
   npx prisma migrate reset
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

3. **Performance issues**
   ```bash
