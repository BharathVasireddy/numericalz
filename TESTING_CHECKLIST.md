## üöÄ **Testing Commands & Tools**

### **Quick Smoke Test:**
```bash
# 1. Build test
npm run build

# 2. Database audit
npm run db:audit

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 4. Test production build
npm start
```

### **Manual Testing URLs:**
- **Login:** http://localhost:3001/auth/login
- **Dashboard:** http://localhost:3001/dashboard
- **Clients:** http://localhost:3001/dashboard/clients
- **VAT Deadlines:** http://localhost:3001/dashboard/clients/vat-dt
- **Ltd Companies:** http://localhost:3001/dashboard/clients/ltd-companies

## üîÑ **Recommended Development Workflow**

### **Option 1: Feature Branch Workflow (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes
# ... development work ...

# 3. Test thoroughly using this checklist
# ... complete testing ...

# 4. Push feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Create Pull Request for review
# 6. Merge to main only after approval & testing
```

### **Option 2: Staging Branch Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Work on feature branches
# 2. Merge to staging branch first
# 3. Deploy staging to test environment
# 4. Test thoroughly in staging
# 5. Merge staging to main only after full verification
```

## üö® **Red Flags - Stop and Investigate**

If ANY of these occur, DO NOT push to main:
- [ ] Authentication fails in any way
- [ ] Database queries throw errors
- [ ] Build process fails
- [ ] Any existing functionality breaks
- [ ] Performance noticeably degrades
- [ ] Console shows new errors
- [ ] Mobile/responsive design breaks
- [ ] Contact icons stop working
- [ ] Assignment system breaks

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Measures**

### **Before Every Push:**
1. **Backup Database:** `npm run db:backup`
2. **Run Build:** `npm run build`
3. **Complete Testing:** Use this checklist
4. **Document Changes:** Clear commit messages

### **After Every Push:**
1. **Monitor Production:** Check live site works
2. **Verify Core Functions:** Auth, client management, VAT
3. **Check for Errors:** Monitor logs and user reports

### **Emergency Procedures:**
1. **Quick Rollback:** `git reset --hard [last-working-commit]`
2. **Database Restore:** `npm run db:restore [backup-file]`
3. **Authentication Rollback:** See `AUTHENTICATION_LOCK.md`

## üìä **Testing Automation (Future Improvement)**

Consider implementing:
- [ ] Automated API testing
- [ ] Automated UI testing (Playwright/Cypress)
- [ ] Database integrity tests
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)

**üéØ REMEMBER: It's better to spend 30 minutes testing than 3 hours fixing production issues!**
